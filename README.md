Bio     
Steven Roberts is the Kenneth K. Chew Endowed Associate Professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. Dr. Roberts received his Ph.D. in Biology at the University of Notre Dame in 2002. His main research interest is the physiological response of aquatic species to environmental change with a particular focus on environmental epigenetics, reproductive biology, and aquaculture.


Abstract     
	It is increasingly evident that environmental perturbations can have impacts on marine invertebrates beyond acute exposure periods. In some instances this might manifest as an adult phenotype that is associated with an early-life stage exposure event. There is also the case where parental environmental exposures can influence offspring phenotype. The processes involved in these intergenerational carryover effects can be diverse in nature, and can be related to physiological compromise in adults that results in negative effects linked to poor quality gametes or insufficient maternal resource allocation. However, in some cases an environmental perturbation experienced by parents might result in a positive effect in offspring, such as improved performance upon secondary exposure to the condition experienced by the parents. Results from recent experiments looking at intergenerational carryover effects in oysters (_Ostrea_ and _Crassostrea_) and geoduck clams will be presented. Specific environmental condtions examined include temperture, diet, and seawater pH. In addition, preliminary data will be discussed in terms of a role for DNA methylation as a mechanisms for environmental memory within and across generations.
